# Flatland

A truly flat map, with no hills, no bodies of water, and no holes, you can build anywhere you wish! Feel free to use the Terraforming tools to add hills or make holes to manually make bodies of water. You have access to the edge of the map at the start so you can import/export any recsources right away.

## Manual Installation

1. Go to the following path in a file exploring app (WinRar, Windows File Explorer, etc.):

`C:\Users\[YourUsername]\AppData\LocalLow\Colossal Order\Cities Skylines II\Maps`

**If the folder does not exist, check to see if you have the [Map Installer Mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/cities-skylines-ii/p/Cities2Modding/MapInstaller/) installed.**

3. Drag and Drop (or just Copy) the following two files into the folder:
   `Flatland.cok` and `Flatland.cok.cid`

4. You should be done! Hop into the game (with your mods enabled) and create a new game, and then pick the map! Have fun!
